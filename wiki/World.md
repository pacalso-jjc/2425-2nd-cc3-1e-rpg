# Setting
This world is set in the medieval period in the time of the Crusades, with the setting being a parallel world of ours. 

There are 2 main factions: 
Thomasia is a faith that originates from the land of Borisya, akin to the Holy Roman Empire in real life. This state takes their faith of Thomasia (which follows the deity of Thomas that is said to someday come back and save the country of Borisya; this faction is meant to be the mirror of Christianity) extremely strictly and as a symbol of their land. Borisya is the size of modern-day Germany, but also having a very well-funded military also serving under the banner of their faith. The leader of this country is "Cult of Saint Thomas Boriysa". Now, this bigger state of Borisya is trying to annex Yrmania via religion and, if it comes to it, military invasion. When the game takes place, Thomasia has brought its military to Yrmania and already has a somewhat strong hold of the nobility.

Ahmed's Legion: This faction is the invading force of Ahmed. They came from the Hammerfell (Middle East). There is very little known about this faction (see characters), but what is known is the Hammerfell is progressing towards certain famine, and Ahmed desires to capture Yrmania because of their fabled fertile soil and for Ahmed to spread his religion. They are a brutal faction with a very organized and mobile military, heavily using cavalry and lightning attacks, but they are light and not very funded. This faction is like the Mongol Empire with a mix of the Middle East.

Yrmania is the state where the game takes place. It is a neutral state which is not affiliated or associated with any religion or organization with its neighboring states. It is the same size as Czechia and Austria combined.
