### **Gameplay Example**  

#### **Scene 1: A Difficult Decision**  

*You and your men stand at the edge of a ruined village. Smoke rises from the remains of wooden houses, and the bodies of fallen Crusaders and Saracens litter the ground. The pilgrims you are escorting whisper prayers under their breath.*  

**Your lieutenant, Sir Robert, approaches.**  
*"Sir William, the road ahead is uncertain. Do we press on, or take another route?"*  

**What will you do?**  
1. **Press on along the main road**—it’s the fastest way to Jaffa.  
2. **Take a detour through the hills**—it will take longer, but may be safer.  
3. **Search the village** for survivors or useful supplies.  

(*Player chooses Option 3: Search the village for survivors or supplies.*)

#### **Scene 2: The Village Ruins**  

*You and two knights cautiously move through the ruined streets, stepping over broken shields and shattered swords. In a collapsed house, you hear faint coughing. A wounded Crusader lies beneath the rubble.*  

**Wounded Soldier:** *"Water... please..."*  

**What will you do?**  
1. Give him water and try to help him.  
2. Question him first—he may know what happened here.  
3. Leave him—time is of the essence.  

(*Player chooses Option 2: Question him first.*)

#### **Scene 3: Enemy Approaching**  

**Wounded Soldier:** *"Saracen scouts… not far… they ambushed us at dawn."*  

*A distant horn echoes through the valley. Sir Robert rushes toward you.*  
*"Saracen riders approach from the south! We must decide quickly, Sir William!"*  

**What will you do?**  
1. **Prepare to fight**—hold your ground and defend the village.  
2. **Retreat into the hills**—avoid battle and lead the pilgrims to safety.  
3. **Set a trap**—use the ruins for an ambush.  

(*Player chooses Option 3: Set a trap in the ruins.*)

#### **Scene 4: The Ambush**  

*You order your men to take defensive positions among the rubble. The Saracen riders approach, unaware of your presence. As they enter the village, you give the signal. Arrows fly from hidden archers, and knights charge from the alleyways. The enemy is caught off guard!*  

**Combat Actions:**  
1. Charge the enemy leader.  
2. Hold position and defend the pilgrims.  
3. Support your archers from cover.  

(*Player chooses Option 1: Charge the enemy leader.*)

#### **Scene 5: The Duel**  

*You find yourself face-to-face with a Saracen captain wielding a curved scimitar. He moves swiftly, dodging your first attack. You barely block his counterstrike with your shield.*  

**Health: 85%**  

**Next Action:**  
1. Feint an attack and strike from the side.  
2. Lock blades and push him back.  
3. Attempt to disarm him.  

(*Player chooses Option 1: Feint an attack and strike from the side.*)  

*Your feint deceives him, and you land a solid blow to his side. He staggers, then falls to one knee. Seeing their leader down, the remaining Saracens flee into the hills.*
