## Faction NPCs

These quests are from NPCs that participate in the main storyline and/or are affiliated with one of the two main factions: Thomasia and the Legion of Ahmed.

### **Stalker Svignee (Thomasian Sanctified Stalker): Darkness Befalls the Land**
- **Quest picked up at:** When Stalker Svignee confronts the player in the lone pathway after the player recovers in the capital.
- **Step 0**
  - After the player gets knocked out and carried to the capital, he comes across a small Thomasian charity event that is also acting as a medium to recruit new militiamen. Trying to get past the crowd blocking his way he will be met with Stalker Svignee, who appears as a heavily armored knight. “You”, he says in an authoritative voice, pointing his sword at the player. “You’re the one who barely survived the attack at the village”. “People around here have been talking. That you have been very lucky. But me? I think you’re more than lucky. You have been chosen to be in a bigger role than you can imagine.” He plants his sword in the ground. “Meet me in the Pilgrimage Site. We will discuss this further when the time comes." Then the player hears a commotion behind them and when they attempt to look back at Stalker Svignee, they have already vanished.
- **Step 1**
  - When the player enters the Thomasian pilgrimage site, they are met with Stalker Svignee who tasks them with helping the pilgrims that are going to the pilgrimage site who are experiencing bullying and discrimination from the locals. Stalker heavily suggests the player to just get rid of the aggressors. Even after suggesting a more peaceful solution, Stalker will still press the player to killing or threatening off the aggressors.
  - 500GP (or the currency decided) is rewarded upon completion.
- **Step 2**
  - After proving their loyalty and willingness to serve Thomasia, the Stalker tasks the player with escorting a charity caravan to the lower district from the capital. What happens is that this caravan is intercepted on the way to the lower district by slum residents that pose as bandits. Even though they will surrender after one or two of them gets defeated, Stalker will suddenly appear on the scene and ask the player to finish them off. If the player declines, Stalker does it himself.
  - 600GP (or the currency decided) and miscellaneous supplies from the caravan such as foods and drinks are rewarded upon completion.
- **Step 3 (Symbiosis: which requires acquisition and learning about the purpose of the vermin key)**
  - Stalker sends the player to Fort Faroth to acquire the aid of the army that is stationed there. He requests the player to assassinate Quartermaster Jeera and replace her with a Thomasian sympathizer.
  - Stalker's Hidden Blade, a unique dagger is rewarded upon completion.
- **Step 4**
  - After solving the situation at Fort Faroth, Stalker will ask the player to ask Old Sage Nik about the true purpose of the Vermin Key, suggesting that they use force if needed. However, on the way to the room that they initially find Old Sage Nik before they acquire the Vermin Key, Stalker will already be there trying to beat the information out of him. This is where it can be revealed that the Vermin Key controlls the underground defense system of the state which is filled with ravenous rats that could consume the entire population if they wanted to. Gaining this information, Stalker Svignee's homicidal and violent tendencies are fully put in display; in contrast to the supposedly benevolent and kind faith of Thomasia.
  - Amulet of the Devout, a unique amulet that boosts HP is rewarded upon  completion.
- **Step 5 (I Am What I Am: which requires completion of Symbiosis)**
  - Right after acquiring the control or aid of Fort Faroth's army, Stalker informs the player that the rival faction of Ahmed is trying to negotiate an alliance and peace-deal with the de-facto leader of the people of the slums, King Bennett. He tasks the player with getting rid of King Bennett and his followers to crush the possibility of rebellion.
  - 750 GP (or the currency decided) and King Bennett's Armour, which is a unique armour that boosts the player's speed (and is also only obtainable this way).
- **Step 6 (Pre-finale)**
  - In preparation for the upcoming battle against Ahmed, Svignee tasks the player with gathering conscripts to fight for the Thomasian army. Svignee says that while the army provided by Borisya is great, they are still severely outnumbered and overextended even with the support of Fort Faroth. He also makes a comment about "you know, this is also a great way to get rid of some of the heretics... yes, visit the Heretic Tower first and bring them the offer of their freedom in exchange for their sword when the time comes. Also, try asking in the Lower District as well...", also urging the player to use force and intimidation if necessary. The prisoners in the Heretic Tower will be guaranteed to join but it will take some effort to convince Magistrate Ken Nough to provide some men.
  - The support of whichever men that they have chosen to conscript to the Thomasian force, as well as Karabasan's Mask, a unique armour piece that greatly boosts speed, charisma, and attacks with small weapons. When Stalker hands over Karabasan's Mask, he makes an offhand comment of how "oh letting go is so hard... no matter. Don't worry about this mask's original owner, I know him very well, and just know that he's out of the picture."

### **Princess Diane Yvette (Heir to the State): In My Time of Need**
- **Quest picked up at:** When the player meets the princess on the way to the Upper City.
- **Step 0**
    - (Diane's questline ties directly with the player's reacquisition and learning about the Vermin Key) if the player chooses to explore the way to the Upper City (where all the nobility lives) early, they are stopped at the gate in a small fortress/drawbridge where the gate is guarded by Senior Knight Hans and a room to the left contains the Princess, who is distressed about the missing key. She doesn't know that the player is actually the one tasked to give her the key, but she tasks the player to go find it (this is basically a failsafe in case the player does not know what they're doing at all)
- **Step 1 (Requires Vermin Key)**
    - Diane will thank the player for bringing back the key and says that she is willing to work with the player after they prove themselves and prove that they are prepared. To proceed, she tasks the player to complete 2 Lower District bounties from Magistrate Ken Nough OR 2 Wilderness bounties from Wenduag.
- **Step 2**
    - Diane says that the player is now ready to be her partner for her plans for the state. She states her plans which are to drive out both the Thomasians and the Legion of Ahmed and push the state of Yrmania to independence for the good of the common people. She points out the flaws in both: although Thomasia seems like the benevolent and good faction their methods and their actual purpose for being in Yrmania is questionable and wrong, in addition she has a disdain for the Legion of Ahmed because as a woman, she has no future or even rights if Ahmed was to take over, not to mention women who are not even in the nobility. She also explains the true purpose of the Vermin Key: there is a defense system underground the state which is comprised of rats and the Vermin Key controls valves at specific areas that release the rats. She then tasks the player to accompany a guardian of hers to the Thomasian Pilgrimage site to spy on the Thomasian officials who are working there. If the player is not affliated with Stalker Svignee at this time, the player can then witness his cruelty in full-view: wherein he orders that those bullying and discriminating the Thomasian pilgrims be executed.
    - 650GP (or the currency decided) is rewarded upon completion.
- **Step 3**
    - After sending the player to spy on the Thomasians, Diane will then task the player to accompany her to the center of the capital wherein she will give a speech and the player is meant to defend her. What happens is a skirmish starts after the Thomasians try to put down the small speech event. Diane will make a comment on "alright, that was not how I wanted that to go, but after that much people saw what happened, there is no doubt that their reputation will take a nose dive. they're starting to get aggressive, so soon it might be time for us to act."
    - 650GP (or the currency decided) and Truesight Amulet, a unique amulet that boosts ranged attacks is rewarded upon completion.
- **Step 4**
    - Diane receives news that the Legion of Ahmed is planning to attack the next village of Summonwater, so she tasks the player to aid the militia there. Afterwards, she will make a comment like "good. we will need every corner of Yrmania's support if we're to become independent. but for now we rest."
    - 650GP (or the currency decided) is rewarded upon completion.
- **Step 5 (Symbiosis)**
    - Diane tasks the player with going to Fort Faroth and requesting the aid of the army stationed there. She requests the player to make contact with Quartermaster A'jak'nir Jeera and request her support and loyalty diplomatically.
    - 800GP (or the currency decided) and Jeera's Arm, a unique armour piece that boosts strength is rewarded upon completion.
- **Step 6 (I Am What I Am: which requires completion of Symbiosis)**
    - Diane gets word that Ahmed himself has started negotiating an alliance and peace-deal with the de-facto leader of the slums, King Bennett. Diane says that she knows King Bennett from when she was still a child living in the slums and urges that the player accompany her and aid her in promising King Bennett to stay neutral or even aid Diane in the upcoming war.
    - 800GP (or the currency decided) and Bennett's Rapier, a unique rapier is rewarded upon completion.
- **Step 7 (Pre-finale)**
    - Just before Ahmed leads his massive assault on the capital and the Thomasians also rally their foreign Borisyan military to attempt and repel them, Diane asks the player once again to accompany and protect her for a speech in the capital, but this time the capital streets are full of militiamen, state soldiers, Upper City knights, and her personal guardians. She gives a rallying speech, making notes about "I know we are surrounded, but think of what we can achieve once this is all over..." and "this is our home... will you really allow the likes of Thomasia or Ahmed's barbarians to take it from you?". The crowd is roused and inspired, and Diane informs the player that whenever the fight may happen, Yrmania is ready.
    - 1000GP (or the currency decided) and Sceleritas Fel's Hat, a unique item that greatly increases initiative (or whatever turn order system, basically it helps you go first) is rewarded after the speech. Diane hands it to the player, gently stating "this was my first and favourite guardian's hat once. I remember the time when I was a sweet girl, when I entered the Upper City for the first time and he was there to greet me. Now I'm here, about to face my greatest challenge ever, I just wish he could be here to see me. Atleast you're here now."

### **Prophet Ahmed (Head of the Legion)**
- **Quest picked up at:** When the player is invited by the robed warrior OR they discover Ahmed's Encampment by themselves.
- **Step 0:**
    - Ahmed first leads the capture of Wuthering village, where the player has stopped by and has gotten drunk. During the prologue of the game, the player can choose to aid an armored fighter or a robed warrior (who is a fighter under the legion of Ahmed). If the player chooses to aid the robed warrior, they will be the one to carry the player to the capital once they get knocked out. Before they get sent to be executed, he invites the player to visit Ahmed himself in his new encampment west of Wuthering. As a failsafe, they can still find the camp by themselves and start Ahmed's questline, only he will have a different attitude towards the player.
- **Step 1:**
    - "Haha. I was not expecting you. Only the valiant and strong aid those that push to conquer the weak, and you quite proved yourself by helping dear Khaled. May he prove a warrior to the very end.", Ahmed remarks if the player chooses to visit him. He introduces himself and his faith: a mission to save the people from the oppressive and authoritarian fist of Thomasia, a faith which focuses on righteous living and prosperity between social classes and the people, and his mission to capture Yrmania to share his faith and accumulate glory. His advisors also mention that they are here because the Hammerfell (the distant land where they come from) is, while peaceful and prosperous, is not sustainable in the long term and Ahmed is looking to expand. Ahmed adds, "before you can become a proper warrior under my banner, you must act and appear like one. Go to Khaled's old war tent and inherit his equipment, then my counsellors shall organize a trial for you." He then tasks you with claiming Khaled's (the robed warrior that the player may have aided at the start of the game and got executed) old equipment and duel 2 legionnaires.
    - Legion Robes, Legion Curved Sword, Legion Sandals, Legion War-hat, and other miscellaneous items are looted from Khaled's war-tent.
- **Step 2:**
    - After winning the duels, Ahmed officially appoints you as one of his warriors and sends you on a mission to pillage a Thomasian caravan and take its supplies back to the Legion's camp. Ahmed praises the player a lot after their victories.
    - 300GP (or the currency decided) and a small amount of the pillaged supplies is rewarded upon completion.
- **Step 3: (Requires Vermin Key to Progress)**
    - When finished pillaging the caravan, Ahmed informs the player that the Legion is ready to capture yet another piece of land: Summonwater village which is the next village closest to Wuthering (do note that this will not make Princess Diane hostile, as she is meant to be THE failsafe character and neutral character). This mission more traditional: the player will accompany Ahmed and his warriors assault Summonwater's guards and then take over the small village. Ahmed, for the first time, is at a loss because even if they manage to win, the Legion sustains heavy casualties and he starts to doubt whether or not his army can take the capital at all. The player can then mention the Vermin Key and Ahmed's morale will be restored and his questline can be progressed.
    - 400GP (or the currency decided) and Prince's Curved Sword, a unique sword that boosts melee attacks.
- **Step 4 (Symbiosis)**
    - After taking Summonwater and learning of the Vermin Key, Ahmed will ask the player to scout out Fort Faroth as he believes that is where he can gain a better chance of taking the capital, either through the equipment there or taking in the army stationed there. He also remarks that "their leader, a traitorous woman from my home, the Hammerfell... hahaha! Tell them that if they lose the seige, then I will personally send her back to the Hammerfell and have her sold.", but he also remarks that the player can intimidate Jeera if they wish.
    - 400GP (or the currency decided) and Authority's Might, a war-hat that greatly boosts charisma.
- **Step 5 (I Am What I Am: which requires completion of Symbiosis)**
    - After resolving the situation at Fort Faroth, Ahmed informs the player that he is off to make an alliance with the people of the slums and their leader, King Bennett and invites the player to join his side. When the player and Ahmed get to the slums, they are welcomed by King Bennett and his followers. To complete this step of Ahmed's quest, the player will need to complete the entirety of Bennett's questline.
    - Bennett's personal allegiance, Bennett's Rapier which is a unique rapier, and Ahmed's Piercer which is a unique spear are all rewarded upon completion.
- **Step 6**
    - Once King Bennett's aid is acquired, Ahmed then informs the player that with the forces that they have put together with Faroth and the Slum's rebels combined, it is now high-time that they take the capital, but first he must pray. Meanwhile, he requests the player to scout out the Thomasian Pilgrimage site so there are no surprises. The player finds out that Stalker Svignee himself has been closely watching their every move and has called the support of the elite foreign Borisyan imported military.
    - Rajj's Regret, a unique amulet that boosts damage after taking damage, is rewarded upon completion.
- **Step 7 (Pre-finale)**
    - When the player informs Ahmed that there will be elite Borisyan military on the side of the Thomasians, he brushes it off initially. Come the night before the assault however, and Ahmed is now worried about their odds of success. The player has to convince and rally Ahmed himself in order to encourage him to carry on and lead his army. Once Ahmed is back to normal, the assault commences
    - "You know, when I first met you, I just thought you were like another curious of my people, me, or my faith. Now I'm here, about to charge into this treacherous battle with you, and now I realize who you truly are: not just a warrior, brother, or advisor by my side... but also a dear friend. Know that whatever happens today, it was an honor fighting with you." Ahmed declares before handing the player the Sultan's Crown, a unique War-Hat that boosts all weapons, and charging into battle.

## Miscellaneous Faction Quests

These quests still involve factions but particularly those not as impactful to the story as Thomasia or the Legion. They are far shorter and less complex.

### **King Bennett (Friend of the People): I Am What I Am**
- **Quest picked up at:** When the player enters the slums for the first time, King Bennett and his entourage confront them and ask why they are visiting. If the player does not immediately attack, then they end their hostilities and King Bennett requests for the player's help. "Listen, Thomasia really ain't making things better for the people over here. If you're interested in making a bit of money, come talk. I have a few things that I need doing, you know, for the good of the people heheheh", he offers.
 - **Objective:** King Bennett will tell you to investigate a recent conflict where a dad and his son were robbed while they were in the slums. The catch is they say that the suspect was this well-dressed noble-looking man who was also armed with a knife. Afterwards, he asks you to check the local water situation, where the tank is being siphoned by an unknown party.
 - **Steps:**
    - **1.** King Bennett will talk to the player and inform them of the case. The player is then meant to find the victims who are conveniently just outside of King Bennett's house. The victims say that the suspect was a well-dressed noble-looking man who fled to the water tanks.
    - **2.** The player reports the suspect who is a well-dressed noble-looking man. King Bennett first takes note of it then sends the player to investigate the water tanks.
    - **3.** The player visits the water tanks to find a group of well-dressed noble-looking men, who say that they were messing with the locals for entertainment. They can be removed via combat or by intimidation.
    - **4.** The player returns to King Bennett informing him that both situations have been solved and King Bennett is pleased.
 - **Reward:** 750GP (or currency) and Odee Perry's Gloves. "This is from my late friend's personal collection, okay? Take good care of it... although yeah it does seem pretty useless. Always wondered how the guy never lost a duel in his life before he got taken out..." King Bennett says to the player as he grants the rewards. The gloves actually greatly increase defense while a rapier is equipped.

### **Senior Knight Hans Gunther Reinhardt (Head Knight of the Upper City): Cold, Cold, Heart**
- **Quest picked up at:** When the player attempts to enter the Upper City early, they can see Senior Knight Hans preventing people from entering the Upper City. If the player requests to get in, they either have to pay an exorbitant fee (5000GP or currency) or instead help him with some errands.
 - **Objective:** Hans requests that the player find his missing comrade, and urges him to check the forests first. Before that, he also tasks the player with delivering a small parcel to Quartermaster Jeera at Fort Faroth (also serving as a device to lead the player there if they're lost).
 - **Steps:**
    - **1.** Hans requests that the player first deliver a small package to Quartermaster Jeera before sending them to investigate his missing comrade.
    - **2.** The player discovers the missing comrade, who wears the same armour as Hans, dead in the wilderness; either via a Wenduag Wilderness Bounty or by regular exploration.
    - **3.** The player informs Hans of his comrade's fate and Hans breaks down in tears, but ultimately faces the harsh truth that his lifelong partner since he was a knight-in-training is now dead.
    - **4.** Hans urges the player to accompany him visit the body in the wilderness. When the pair reach the body of Han's comrade, he recites a prayer about wishing the dead a safe journey, before digging a grave and placing his comrade inside. "Hm. I appreciate you staying around for an old knight in mourning. One thing in my life never changes, loss. ", he mutters to the player. "but for now, we can only look forward. Unfortunately for you, I still cannot grant you entry to the Upper City, it's too dangerous for the nobles especially with the war going on... but I think this gift suits you far better."
 - **Reward:** After he speaks the above dialogue, he hands the player the Young Oath Greatsword, a unique greatsword that uses the player's charisma for damage and attacking.

### **Lady Orin (Scion of Bhaal): A Father's Love**
- **Quest picked up at:** When the player enters the slums for the first time, aside from meeting King Bennett and his entourage, they also start receiving bloodstained letters from an unknown source. These bloodstained letters are all written like a poem, describing dark details and ends of famous warriors in the history of the Middlelands. They are all signed by the same hand: Orin.
 - **Objective:** Find out where the bloodstained letters are coming from, and who this "Orin" is and what they want.
 - **Steps:**
    - **1.** The riddles hidden in the bloodstained letters eventually lead the player to a small shack that supposedly sells paintings but instead has a small hole in the floor with a ladder that leads to the Undercity Catacombs.
    - **2.** Further riddles reveal that there is a big door that enters into the "Procession of our dear lord Bhaal". This leads them to the door to the Bhaal Church, the Bhaal Church itself, and to Orin, who appears as this extremely beautiful woman who is extremely insane.
    - **3.** Orin tasks the player with first proving their loyalty to her by luring a stray Thomasian to the Bhaal church to be sacrificed. The player can choose to actually bring a stray Thomasian from either the pilgrimage site or the heretic tower, but they can also bring any normal person and then convince Orin that they are actually a Thomasian. Regardless in order to proceed Orin's storyline, they need to be sacrificed.
    - **4.** Orin then tasks the player with kidnapping a fighter from the Legion of Ahmed to be sacrificed next. Just like the last step, the player can actually kidnap a legionnaire or they can bring a normal person and convince Orin that they are indeed from Ahmed's Legion.
    - **5.** After the two recent sacrifices, Orin then asks the player to prove their dedication by doing something "divinely unspeakable". She requests the player to kidnap this Thomasian priest who is fabled to be extremely abusive and cruel to his devotees. Orin also makes an offhand comment about "ohh don't worry about him... he's probably more cruel than you are! Even he would make a perfect servant of Bhaal himself... trust me, no one will miss him." Whatever happens to this priest once he is brought to the Bhaal Church is unknown, but once this step is complete, Orin praises the player and is thrilled that she has, especially unwillingly, "brought someone unto Bhaal".
 - **Reward:** Crimson Mischief, a unique shortsword that causes the player to deal double damage on the first turn of combat, is rewarded upon completion.
 - **The Age of Blood Ending:** To unlock this extremely dark and unique secret ending, the player must express romantic interest towards Orin during her entire questline. After her questline is completed, she will ask the player if they did all that they have done for her, for Bhaal, or for both of them. The player MUST say both of them in order to actually unlock this ending. She will be thrilled that the player feels that way, and then she reveals to the player that her lifelong purpose and dream would be to essentially coat Yrmania in blood in Bhaal's name. The player then has to share the existence of their Vermin Key to progress this short questline. After sharing the Vermin Key and its apparent destructive potential, she will be ecstatic and will urge the player for them to use the Vermin Key together when the time is right. The player now has to side and progress with atleast ONE faction but NOT complete the pre-finale step of their questline, but instead return to Orin and wait for Ahmed's assault to start. Once the assault has started, they can then sneak to the Upper City and unleash the rats together, playing out the extremely dark and special Age of Blood Ending.

# Endings (Purely Story & Flavour)

## Age of the Faith (Thomasia)

### Story

- In a time where states lived and died by the sword and by violence more than the word of law or promises of fruitful futures, Yrmania was eventually swayed and ultimately influenced by the Thomasian faith to grow the ever expanding empire. Our tale ends with the player and the mysterious armoured figure known as Stalker Svignee using the Vermin Key to consume and destroy the encampment of Ahmed as well as their forces while they were being repelled outside the walls of the capital. As the decades go by, Yrmania just became a subsidiary region of Borisya, the royal family being displaced from nobility and its autonomy being erased from the picture. The Thomasian armies marched through the state as if it was their own, and Yrmania was now under the rule of the Cult of Saint Thomas Borisya itself. Was it fruitful? Maybe. Were the commandments and orders of the faith followed by their followers? Of course. But will life in Yrmania be better or worse under the thumb of Thomasia? Only time will tell.

### Perspectives

- **Quartermaster A'jak'nir Jeera:** "When the Borisyan military entered the state and also annexed the Fort itself, we knew we would still be safe... maybe even safer. We just wish that Jeera was here to experience it all. Now, she will never have to worry about the army, ever again."

- **King Bennett:** "Life in the streets will never be the same with King Bennett and his men gone. Troops now regularly stop by the streets in case they're in the mood for bullying... or worse. Now the situation in here's 10 times as worse than when Bennett was still alive, trying to fish us out of this hole that the nobility put us in, and now with Thomasia in control of the state, it'd take a miracle for the change we want to happen. Long Live King Bennett."

- **Old Sage Nik:** "Now that Thomasia's walking into the capital like it's really theirs, I guess now I know that I chose wrong. While yeah, life in the army is great, more men and more safety than ever, but that's about it. My family down in the lower district might as well be hanging around in the slums with how poor they are, and I can't even imagine the situation in the actual slums with the young man Bennett gone. Even worse when news spread about how the church's been gold-digging those in the Upper City for extra cash... who knows what they're going to do with it..."

- **Wenduag:** "I've tried my best to keep my hunting a secret and only open to those that really want in... but ever since the Thomasian military showed up in droves they treated my Wilderness like a public hunting ground... sadly that means I'm going out of business soon."

- **Thomasia Pilgrimage Site:** "Now that it's official state law that Yrmania's official religion is Thomasia, we can finally be free from any discrimination whatsoever! What's more is that the higher-ups have been demanding extra tithes from the Upper-city folk, guess that means more charity donations for us!"

- **Magistrate Ken Nough:** "It's weird to think that Thomasia seemed perfect at first glance but when the religion became official nothing good ever came to my lower district. Harsh tithes, abusive priests, drunk soldiers everwhere... its just a mess. It does come with its benefits though. Protection from the Borisya empire is one thing, but having a huge force at the royalty's fingertips is also no doubt great for Yrmania... I just hope control doesn't go to the same one that unleashed those rats."

- **Senior Knight Hans Gunther Reinhardt:** "I can finally retire. Thomasia finally becoming official and ties being secured with Borisya is no doubt good for Yrmania. More security for the nobles, more men to fight for the state, people encourage to follow a law and good oriented faith... my knights can now focus on important things, and as for me? I can now focus on retiring."


## Age of Honor (Legion of Ahmed)

### Story

- In a time where states lived and died by the sword and by violence more than the word of law or promises of fruitful futures, Yrmania was one of the many states that would be swayed by the blade and sheer force of the Legion of Ahmed. After the player and Ahmed himself released the rats to ravage the capital, the Thomasian pilgrimage site, and the Upper City itself, bodies littered what used to be the most populated streets of Yrmania. Ahmed only oversaw the state of Yrmania's conversion briefly, but he made numerous reforms to their healthcare, agriculture, way of life, and social norms. Unfortunately, many if not all captured Thomasians and Thomasian military were either executed, beaten, or went missing; who knows what the Legion has done with them, as they have so far proven ruthless against the oppossition. Afterwards, he set off to find his next big conquest, maybe venturing even further into the west past the growing empire of Borisya, and whether he took the player with him, we don't know. What we do know is that life in the state of Yrmania will never be the same.

### Perspectives

- **Quartermaster A'jak'nir Jeera:** "A lot of my army was lost when Ahmed sent them to assault the capital to only die to the rats. For that, I am forever in grief. I guess their sacrifices were not all in vain? I look out to the capital from my post, to the slums, to the city streets... people run around with smiles in their faces, eating good food and all. I'm also glad I surrendered when I had the chance, didn't really expect the great warrior Ahmed to not deport me, even if they won against Thomasia. I pray for women like me though, I'd rather oversee Fort Faroth forever than be a regular woman under Ahmed again."

- **King Bennett:** "Hehehe! Looks like that deal with Ahmed payed off... while yeah, my sisters aren't doing too good, I think overall life here's improved. There's also been a mission by them folks that cleaned up the slums a bit, so now you can't tell the difference between here slums and the lower district! Still upset that lots of my brothers died during the rats in the capital thing... but atleast we don't constantly eat garbage anymore. Shout out to them..."

- **Old Sage Nik:** "I was not expecting Ahmed of all people to have a somewhat positive impact on the populace of Yrmania, but here we are... the first royal family will be head over heels when they find out that their state's been basically colonized and converted by a foreign power, but I don't think they'll complain with the quality of life in here."

- **Wenduag:** "Lot's of Ahmed warriors now flock line up to my Wilderness to participate in my hunting bounties, for fun and for entertainment. Good for business overall. I worry for regular women especially in the capital, good thing the warriors that visit me know who they're dealing with."

- **Magistrate Ken Nough:** "Well this is a surprise... was not really expecting what we thought were the "thieving savages from the East" to have such a good impact on my lower district. Don't get me wrong, I was praying to Thomas himself for Ahmed to lose, but now I'm not complaining. I pray for women though, especially my mama. Word on the street is a man can just do what they want with any woman they see. It's sad and I hope it changes eventually, but for now we pray."

- **Senior Knight Hans Gunther Reinhardt:** "Damn. I failed. Nearly everyone in the Upper City... eaten by those rats, all because I failed to prevent Ahmed and his pawn from reaching the royal family's keep. I'm leaving Yrmania in exile. No one wants to hear about how almost all of the nobility died during that fight all because of me. I just home my order doesn't come looking for me, I don't want to taint my honor anymore than I already have."

- **Ahmed's Counsellors:** "What a valiant resolution to the war... well fought on both sides we will say, but in war only one shall emerge victorious. The great Ahmed has left, and has entrusted the state of Yrmania to us, and as Ahmed's counsellors that have watched him grow to the astounding fighter he is, seeing him leave without us leaves us with a great sadness, and as such we promise to uphold his legacy and teachings in the state of Yrmania as best as we can. It is what he would have wanted."

## Age of the Crown (Princess Diane Yvette)

### Story

- In a time where states lived and died by the sword and by violence more than the word of law or promises of fruitful futures, Yrmania was one that could resist and emerge as a force of its own, carving out its own destiny. In the chaotic skirmish between Thomasia and Ahmed's legion, Princess Diane and the player rushed to the Upper City to release the rats in Ahmed's Encampment, the walls of the capital where they were fighting, and the Thomasian headquarters specifically in the Thomasian Pilgrimage Site. Survivors of the fighting were assimilated into the state's army and, along with the help of King Bennett, local militiamen from the slums and the lower district that sought to fight for a better future during and after the war has ended eventually joined the state military. She has also made several changes to the power of the nobility and social hierarchy, also declaring Yrmania as an independent state. The question now is, as time goes on, will the now Queen Diane Yvette hold her grip on her newborn and now independent state of New Yrmania?

### Perspectives

- **Quartermaster A'jak'nir Jeera:** "Diane is a good person, I've met her in the past and she treats my army well. The question now is if she's even capable in leading a nation... even one as small as Yrmania. But in the conflict between Thomasia and Ahmed, she proved that she's better for the common people than either of them."

- **King Bennett:** "Diane my sister now and she earned that title. The slums didn't instantly become perfect when the girl became Queen, but they way better than what they was just a week or two before. And I'm glad my brothers agreed to join the militiamen, gives them purpose and something to fight for. The thing with Diane is she seems soft so far... so whoever her consort is? Better have what she lacks."

- **Old Sage Nik:** "Oh I pray for Yrmania. While I'm certainly proud of what it has become, I do not trust the girl Diane nor do I trust her ability to govern. Who knows what will happen if the Hammerfell comes looking for Ahmed or if Borisya chooses to invade? Oh dear..."

- **Wenduag:** "Diane leaves me alone and I leave her politics alone, win-win! After the war, lots more people have been coming to my Wilderness, but not just hunters unluckily. A lot of children go missing in the forest and it isn't good for business, but so far business has been better."

- **Magistrate Ken Nough:** "Would you look at that... I always thought that Diane was the most naive and immature child of the royal family, but I guess I was wrong. So far ever since she redistributed the wealth the Upper City have been hogging inside their walls and even opening up the Upper City for everyone, Yrmania's economy has been skyrocketing and I bet it's going to keep being that way for a long time. Even better, since the economy's trending upwards, quality of life just keeps growing and people in the lower district can now go back to focusing on being happy."

- **Senior Knight Hans Gunther Reinhardt:** "Was not entrusted to watching Diane grow up, but I guess she didn't need me to protect her at all... although since she does next to nothing for the people in the Upper City, even letting commoners in now, my knights and I have to work twice as hard nowadays..."

- **The Nobles** "Oh no... look what this woman has done. We have been saying that she was bad news, but did the royal family listen? Nooooo. They just let her do what she wants and look what happened. We're just commoners that look and sound different! And she's too "smart" to listen to us, rats! She's also going to end up bleeding the coffers dry on her preposterous slum improvement projects... as if those peasants don't deserve to be there! And oh our poor poor alliance with Borisya, how could we forget... now who's going to defend us when something goes wrong? The girl? Chk... well you know, if at first you don't succeed..."

## Age of Blood (Lady Orin)

### Story

- In a time where states lived and died by the sword and by violence more than the word of law or promises of fruitful futures, who would ever expect that an entire state's death would come from their own defenses? During the assault on the capital by the Legion of Ahmed, an unknown figure and the player would discreetly make their way to the Upper City and use the Vermin Key. The catch is the two made the Vermin Key activate all the valves across the land. Thomasian, Legion fighter, noble, commoner, slum resident, hermit, villager, man, or woman, all did not survive the onslaught of rats that was released into the entire state. For the first time in decades, the State of Yrmania fell completely silent, the land littered with bodies; the rats did not discriminate. As the sun sets across the blood-stained horizon, the player lays down on a bloodstained bed in the royal-family's keep. After sleeping like a babe for the first time in weeks if not months, they are greeted and awoken by gentle arms that wrap around their body. They check who it is, and it is she: their consort, their partner, their Queen, their Lady Orin: Scion of Bhaal.

### Perspectives

- Over the hills and far away, a neighbouring tower of Borisya that is meant to watch over Yrmania is met with a horrifying sight.
    - ???: Sir... Yrmania. It's... red?
    - ???: Preposterous, lad! Let me see- ...by the name of Thomas, what happened? The streets, the grass, the wilderness, red...
    - ???: Sir what do we do? Do we prepare for an expedition?
    - ???: No lad... I shudder at the thought of sending young men in that cursed land... send word to the Emperor. Yrmania is to be left alone.
    - ???: But sir, Stalker Svignee could still be out there... the emperor would want him to report bac-
    - ???: That's where you're wrong lad... if he was alive he would let you know. That... Svignee... was different, unnatural, but seems like there are evils even he cannot survive.
- A group of robed scouts on horses arrive in the ruins of the Ahmed encampment, now submerged in bodies and red.
    - Zeke: Khaled... what do you see? This place... reeks of death. But these are our war tents.
    - Khaled: Wait... those are the counsellor's robes... oh no. These are our brothers, but they've been torn apart, more akin to the work of a devil than that of a man...
    - Zeke: Wait- did you hear that? Flee!
    - Khaled: Let's go, now! Whatever did this, we must warn the Rajj... I shudder to imagine that evil spreading and reaching the Hammerfell. Whatever this evil is, even our great Ahmed would fall to.
