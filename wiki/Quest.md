# Main Quest

## **Prologue/Quest 1: Reawakening**

It’s noon, and you have just been assigned a task. Usually, you finish tasks as quickly as they have been given, but It’s hectic out there, and sometimes you need a little drink. What could go wrong?

### **Scene 1**

You wake up in the tavern feeling like maybe a bit too drunk. As you try to pick yourself up, a man rushes into the tavern and screams, “The Legion is here!”. Everyone inside the tavern hurriedly rushed outside the tavern as if their lives mattered on it. “Who’s the Legion?”, you asked yourself. Nevertheless, you groggily dragged yourself out of the tavern and your eyes widened. An attack is happening in the village. Houses on fire and bodies scattered. A bloody sword lies in front of you and two people are fighting each other. You pick up the sword and try attacking one of them, but your eyes fail you and you see a blurry mess.

What will you do?

- **1.** Attack the person who seems to be wearing leather armor – attacking him means siding to the Legion

You attacked the armored person and assisted him. The robed person mutters something in another language, but before you try to understand it, you get hit in the back of your head by something.

- **2.** Attack the person who seems to be robed – attacking him means defending the village

You attacked the robed person and successfully defeated the robed person. “You have my thanks.”, said the armored person. But before you could say any words, the person shouted, “Look out!” before being hit in the back of your head by something.  

**Whatever the choice of the player picks, it will always end up in them being hit in the head.**

You try to open your eyes, but you can only see glimpses. You seem to be being carried by someone. You try to talk, but nothing comes out of your mouth. Your vision fades away.

### **Scene 2 (Character Creation)**

You wake up in a hospital. You are surrounded by wounded people being tended. A doctor notices that you have woken up and asks how you are feeling.

- **1.** “I feel… alright.” – the doctor responds that you’re very lucky as your head injury is very fatal, yet you lived.
- **2.** “I am awake, so…” – the doctor responds to your humor well, saying that even in a fatal condition, you manage to crack a joke.
- **2.** Remain Silent – the doctor assures that everything may be a bit confusing thanks to your head injury.

The doctor asks what is your name. You try to say it, but you somehow can’t. But still, you try to mutter something that resembles a name.

**This part is where the character will type their name**

You didn’t know if it was your name or someone, but it’s who you are for the time being.
The doctor then picks up a mirror and shows it to you. You see a figure, but you don’t know who it is.

**This is the part where the player makes their character**

You aren’t certain if what you see in the mirror is really you or not, but it’s who you are now.
The doctor hypothesized that the injury may have made you amnesiac. But that doesn’t matter. What matters is that you survived, and he thanks the person that carried you to the hospital whoever they may be. In the meantime, the doctor releases you from the hospital. He asks you to try exploring. Maybe you can remember something from exploring the place.

## **Scene 3**

You are now outside the hospital and are now free to roam and explore. Everyone seems to be busier than usual, especially the number of soldiers marching outside the capital.

**The player is now free to roam around and ask people about the situation**

- **NPCs will answer the following:**
	- **The soldiers are because of the invasion of the Legion of Ahmed into the state**
	- **The amount of people as refugees from the war**
	- **Some saying that you are the first to be released from the hospital**
	- **Some being shocked from the bandages in your head**

**Only one NPC will continue the quest. The NPC will continue the story**

Someone catches your attention. It is a person carrying a box. He seems to recognize you, but you don’t.
He puts down the box and asks where you’ve been, and he notices your bandages. “Oh no, have you got yourself in a mess laddie?”.

- **1.** “I did, but I don’t seem to remember much.” – he tries to take it as a joke, but he realizes you are not kidding.
- **2.** “Nope, I just tripped over. You know, very normal injuries.” – he laughs, but the severity of your injuries says nonetheless, and he becomes worried.
- **3.** “Who are you, and where am I?” – he becomes worried about the state of your condition.

“Don’t you remember? It's me! The guy who delivers equipment to your shop every day!”. But you don’t seem to remember. He sighs and accepts the situation that you have forgotten everything. Someone from his job taps into his shoulder, and he hurriedly tries to explain to you where you are right now. He suggests that you try going to your job in hopes that you can remember something. He gives you the direction to take and bids you farewell.

With the directions given you try to get to the place, but groups of people block your way. It seems to be a charity service being done by a religion asking for the people who have the capacity to be a warrior join the militia in aid of the defense of the state. They are also asking for donations of provisions to aid injured people and such. You try finding another way to the place by going through a narrow pathway

Suddenly, a menacing armored person confronts you halfway through the narrow pathway. “You”, he says in an authoritative voice, pointing his sword at you. “You’re the one who barely survived the attack at the village”. “People around here have been talking. That you have been very lucky. But me? I think you’re more than lucky. You have been chosen to be in a bigger role than you can imagine.” He plants his sword in the ground. “Meet me in the Pilgrimage Site. We will discuss this further when the time comes.” You hear a commotion behind you, and the moment you look back, the person disappears.

## **Scene 4 (Class Creation)**

Emerging from the pathway, you see the barracks in front of you. A person recognizes you from the barracks and immediately grabs you. “No time to waste! You’re already behind schedule!”. He takes you into the barracks and puts you into a room full of weapons and armor. “For someone who has an important task, you sure are late! Here, choose whatever you want or need. You are going to need it for that task. Not to mention, a lot of volunteers have been draining the barracks of equipment”. You hear something outside and the person immediately screams, “Give me a moment, I’m coming!”, storming outside in a hurry.

**This is the part where the player can choose their class**

You pick up everything you need and the person comes back. “Oh good, you’re all ready. Now, leave. I still have a lot of things to tend to.” Another commotion happens and he screams at the door. “WILL YOU PEOPLE WAIT YOUR TURN”. Before any trouble begins, you immediately leave the barracks and continue your task of finding the place.

## **End of Prologue/Quest 1**

## **Quest 2: "Once Again"**

### **Scene 1:**

	From the barracks, you see the way towards the place has been cleared. You continue your walk. You encounter a very busy place full of parchments and such. It seems that you’re in a courier service.
The player is free to ask the NPCs.

- **NPCs will answer the following:**

	- **The parchment being letters**
	- **Some of the boxes being packages**
	- **Ever since the war, the service has been in disarray**

**Interacting a certain NPC (Keeper) one will progress the quest**

The keeper recognizes you and asks you about your current task. This confuses you but confirms that this place is indeed where you work.

- **1.** “Can you please remind me what it is again?” - the keeper says it’s an important one
- **2.** “Oh yeah, the task. Uhh, what was it again?” - the keeper rolls their eyes and says it’s an important task.
- **3.** “What task?” - the keeper is confused but she reminds you it’s important.

A crowd of people exclaims for you to wait your turn. The keeper is seen to be exhausted to be angry but she gives you directions to the person who assigned the task.

Inside the busy building are piles of unsorted piles of parchment being sorted by only a handful of people. A door can be seen at the end of the building and you enter.

A woman greets you and asks you how the delivery went. You shake your head and shrug. The woman notices the injury in your head and becomes concerned. She deduces that you may have forgotten your task thanks to the injury so she explains it in secrecy. But before that, she made sure that no one outside the door may be listening.

“You have an important task given upon you. A letter and a package for the princess. You were supposed to meet with someone to get the package from the village, but everyone said that the village was attacked.”

She asks you if you still have the letter and the package, but you don’t remember the doctor giving you anything. She sighs in worry, but she immediately composes herself.

“I do not know how to help you, but I suggest you start with the people who helped you here. Perhaps the doctor who tended to you. ”

A knock is heard from the door. She stands and acknowledges. “You may go, good luck”.

### **Scene 2:**

You exit the door and went outside the building. You remember something about the doctor saying about someone carrying you to the hospital. They may know something.

You go back to the hospital and find the doctor. You ask if they know the whereabouts of the person who carried you back here.

The answer may depend on what choice you have picked on who to attack in the prologue

- **Attack Armored Person** - the doctor says that the person who was carrying you was one of the invading force and is now on the chopping block. Though you can find him in the prison as the beheading is still in the later afternoon.
- **Attack Robed Person** - the doctor says that the person has been recently released from the hospital and can be found in the barracks.

You go to the person who saved you earlier. You thank them and ask if they saw something from them being taken before they found you.

They explain that there was someone who took the package from you discreetly. Though it looked like one of them wore the emblem of the Caravan Company.

**If the player saves the robed person, they will invite the player to The Legion of Ahmed, giving him a keyword that grants him to enter the encampment near the village.** 


- **SPECIAL EVENT** 
	- The Legionnaire will insist on staying in the cell as, in his own words, “My part is not yet in play.”. Guards immediately approach and unlock the cell to escort the prisoner. He stops and looks at you. “You have proven yourself worthy of The Prophet. But the question remains. Are you simply His audience, or will you be part of the grand play?”. He then resumes his walk with the guards to the outside of the prison.

### **Scene 3:**

You exit out of the building and see a crowd of people gathering somewhere.

- **Asking the NPCs will answer the following:**
	- **An execution is said to be happening**
	- **It’s a captured Legionnaire from the Legion of Ahmed**
	- **Something is said to be happening, so they went along**

You follow along the crowd to the plaza and see the Legionnaire alongside a couple of guards and an executioner on a wooden platform. The Legionnaire is bound on a pillory. The crowd throws debris at the Legionnaire whilst being called names and such. “This state’s salvation is at hand! The Prophet alongside his disciples will cleanse the lands of weakness, and from the ashes, a state pure and free from corruption will arise!”, shouted the Legionnaire. The crowd boos the Legionnaire but you can feel a change of emotion in the air. It is anger, with a tinge of fear. “Worry not! We will all be free of suffering by His will! Long live the prophet! Long live the Legio-”. Before the Legionnaire finishes his last words, the executioner’s axe swiftly cuts down his neck followed by a thud on the platform. The Legionnaire is dead, and the crowd angers still. You immediately leave the plaza, and focus on the matter on your hand.
