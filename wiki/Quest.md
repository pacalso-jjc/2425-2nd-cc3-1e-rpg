# Main Quest

## **Prologue/Quest 1: Reawakening**

It’s noon, and you have just been assigned a task. Usually, you finish tasks as quickly as they have been given, but It’s hectic out there, and sometimes you need a little drink. What could go wrong?

### **Scene 1**

You wake up in the tavern feeling like maybe a bit too drunk. As you try to pick yourself up, a man rushes into the tavern and screams, “The Legion is here!”. Everyone inside the tavern hurriedly rushed outside the tavern as if their lives mattered on it. “Who’s the Legion?”, you asked yourself. Nevertheless, you groggily dragged yourself out of the tavern and your eyes widened. An attack is happening in the village. Houses on fire and bodies scattered. A bloody sword lies in front of you and two people are fighting each other. You pick up the sword and try attacking one of them, but your eyes fail you and you see a blurry mess.

What will you do?

- **1.** Attack the person who seems to be wearing leather armor – attacking him means siding to the Legion

You attacked the armored person and assisted him. The robed person mutters something in another language, but before you try to understand it, you get hit in the back of your head by something.

- **2.** Attack the person who seems to be robed – attacking him means defending the village

You attacked the robed person and successfully defeated the robed person. “You have my thanks.”, said the armored person. But before you could say any words, the person shouted, “Look out!” before being hit in the back of your head by something.  

**Whatever the choice of the player picks, it will always end up in them being hit in the head.**

You try to open your eyes, but you can only see glimpses. You seem to be being carried by someone. You try to talk, but nothing comes out of your mouth. Your vision fades away.

### **Scene 2 (Character Creation)**

You wake up in a hospital. You are surrounded by wounded people being tended. A doctor notices that you have woken up and asks how you are feeling.

- **1.** “I feel… alright.” – the doctor responds that you’re very lucky as your head injury is very fatal, yet you lived.
- **2.** “I am awake, so…” – the doctor responds to your humor well, saying that even in a fatal condition, you manage to crack a joke.
- **2.** Remain Silent – the doctor assures that everything may be a bit confusing thanks to your head injury.

The doctor asks what is your name. You try to say it, but you somehow can’t. But still, you try to mutter something that resembles a name.

**This part is where the character will type their name**

You didn’t know if it was your name or someone, but it’s who you are for the time being.
The doctor then picks up a mirror and shows it to you. You see a figure, but you don’t know who it is.

**This is the part where the player makes their character**

You aren’t certain if what you see in the mirror is really you or not, but it’s who you are now.
The doctor hypothesized that the injury may have made you amnesiac. But that doesn’t matter. What matters is that you survived, and he thanks the person that carried you to the hospital whoever they may be. In the meantime, the doctor releases you from the hospital. He asks you to try exploring. Maybe you can remember something from exploring the place.

## **Scene 3**

You are now outside the hospital and are now free to roam and explore. Everyone seems to be busier than usual, especially the number of soldiers marching outside the capital.

**The player is now free to roam around and ask people about the situation**

- **NPCs will answer the following:**
	- **The soldiers are because of the invasion of the Legion of Ahmed into the state**
	- **The amount of people as refugees from the war**
	- **Some saying that you are the first to be released from the hospital**
	- **Some being shocked from the bandages in your head**

**Only one NPC will continue the quest. The NPC will continue the story**

Someone catches your attention. It is a person carrying a box. He seems to recognize you, but you don’t.
He puts down the box and asks where you’ve been, and he notices your bandages. “Oh no, have you got yourself in a mess laddie?”.

- **1.** “I did, but I don’t seem to remember much.” – he tries to take it as a joke, but he realizes you are not kidding.
- **2.** “Nope, I just tripped over. You know, very normal injuries.” – he laughs, but the severity of your injuries says nonetheless, and he becomes worried.
- **3.** “Who are you, and where am I?” – he becomes worried about the state of your condition.

“Don’t you remember? It's me! The guy who delivers equipment to your shop every day!”. But you don’t seem to remember. He sighs and accepts the situation that you have forgotten everything. Someone from his job taps into his shoulder, and he hurriedly tries to explain to you where you are right now. He suggests that you try going to your job in hopes that you can remember something. He gives you the direction to take and bids you farewell.

With the directions given you try to get to the place, but groups of people block your way. It seems to be a charity service being done by a religion asking for the people who have the capacity to be a warrior join the militia in aid of the defense of the state. They are also asking for donations of provisions to aid injured people and such. You try finding another way to the place by going through a narrow pathway

Suddenly, a menacing armored person confronts you halfway through the narrow pathway. “You”, he says in an authoritative voice, pointing his sword at you. “You’re the one who barely survived the attack at the village”. “People around here have been talking. That you have been very lucky. But me? I think you’re more than lucky. You have been chosen to be in a bigger role than you can imagine.” He plants his sword in the ground. “Meet me in the Pilgrimage Site. We will discuss this further when the time comes.” You hear a commotion behind you, and the moment you look back, the person disappears.

## **Scene 4 (Class Creation)**

Emerging from the pathway, you see the barracks in front of you. A person recognizes you from the barracks and immediately grabs you. “No time to waste! You’re already behind schedule!”. He takes you into the barracks and puts you into a room full of weapons and armor. “For someone who has an important task, you sure are late! Here, choose whatever you want or need. You are going to need it for that task. Not to mention, a lot of volunteers have been draining the barracks of equipment”. You hear something outside and the person immediately screams, “Give me a moment, I’m coming!”, storming outside in a hurry.

**This is the part where the player can choose their class**

You pick up everything you need and the person comes back. “Oh good, you’re all ready. Now, leave. I still have a lot of things to tend to.” Another commotion happens and he screams at the door. “WILL YOU PEOPLE WAIT YOUR TURN”. Before any trouble begins, you immediately leave the barracks and continue your task of finding the place.

## **End of Prologue/Quest 1**
