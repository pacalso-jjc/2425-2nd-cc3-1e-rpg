# Main Quest

## **Prologue/Quest 1: "Reawakening"**

It’s noon, and you have just been assigned a task. Usually, you finish tasks as quickly as they have been given, but It’s hectic out there, and sometimes you need a little drink. What could go wrong?

### **Scene 1**

You wake up in the tavern feeling like maybe a bit too drunk. As you try to pick yourself up, a man rushes into the tavern and screams, “The Legion is here!”. Everyone inside the tavern hurriedly rushed outside the tavern as if their lives mattered on it. “Who’s the Legion?”, you asked yourself. Nevertheless, you groggily dragged yourself out of the tavern and your eyes widened. An attack is happening in the village. Houses on fire and bodies scattered. A bloody sword lies in front of you and two people are fighting each other. You pick up the sword and try attacking one of them, but your eyes fail you and you see a blurry mess.

What will you do?

- **1.** Attack the person who seems to be wearing leather armor – attacking him means siding to the Legion

You attacked the armored person and assisted him. The robed person mutters something in another language, but before you try to understand it, you get hit in the back of your head by something.

- **2.** Attack the person who seems to be robed – attacking him means defending the village

You attacked the robed person and successfully defeated the robed person. “You have my thanks.”, said the armored person. But before you could say any words, the person shouted, “Look out!” before being hit in the back of your head by something.  

**Whatever the choice of the player picks, it will always end up in them being hit in the head.**

You try to open your eyes, but you can only see glimpses. You seem to be being carried by someone. You try to talk, but nothing comes out of your mouth. Your vision fades away.

### **Scene 2 (Character Creation)**

You wake up in a hospital. You are surrounded by wounded people being tended. An apothecary notices that you have woken up and asks how you are feeling.

- **1.** “I feel… alright.” – the apothecary responds that you’re very lucky as your head injury is very fatal, yet you lived.
- **2.** “I am awake, so…” – the apothecary responds to your humor well, saying that even in a fatal condition, you manage to crack a joke.
- **2.** Remain Silent – the apothecary assures that everything may be a bit confusing thanks to your head injury.

The apothecary asks what is your name. You try to say it, but you somehow can’t. But still, you try to mutter something that resembles a name.

**This part is where the character will type their name**

You didn’t know if it was your name or someone, but it’s who you are for the time being.
The doctor then picks up a mirror and shows it to you. You see a figure, but you don’t know who it is.

**This is the part where the player makes their character**

You aren’t certain if what you see in the mirror is really you or not, but it’s who you are now.
The apothecary hypothesized that the injury may have made you amnesiac. But that doesn’t matter. What matters is that you survived, and he thanks the person that carried you to the hospital whoever they may be. In the meantime, the apothecary releases you from the hospital. He asks you to try exploring. Maybe you can remember something from exploring the place.

### **Scene 3**

You are now outside the hospital and are now free to roam and explore. Everyone seems to be busier than usual, especially the number of soldiers marching outside the capital.

**The player is now free to roam around and ask people about the situation**

- **NPCs will answer the following:**
	- **The soldiers are because of the invasion of the Legion of Ahmed into the state**
	- **The amount of people as refugees from the war**
	- **Some saying that you are the first to be released from the hospital**
	- **Some being shocked from the bandages in your head**

**Only one NPC will continue the quest. The NPC will continue the story**

Someone catches your attention. It is a person carrying a box. He seems to recognize you, but you don’t.
He puts down the box and asks where you’ve been, and he notices your bandages. “Oh no, have you got yourself in a mess laddie?”.

- **1.** “I did, but I don’t seem to remember much.” – he tries to take it as a joke, but he realizes you are not kidding.
- **2.** “Nope, I just tripped over. You know, very normal injuries.” – he laughs, but the severity of your injuries says nonetheless, and he becomes worried.
- **3.** “Who are you, and where am I?” – he becomes worried about the state of your condition.

“Don’t you remember? It's me! The guy who delivers equipment to your shop every day!”. But you don’t seem to remember. He sighs and accepts the situation that you have forgotten everything. Someone from his job taps into his shoulder, and he hurriedly tries to explain to you where you are right now. He suggests that you try going to your job in hopes that you can remember something. He gives you the direction to take and bids you farewell.

With the directions given you try to get to the place, but groups of people block your way. It seems to be a charity service being done by a religion asking for the people who have the capacity to be a warrior join the militia in aid of the defense of the state. They are also asking for donations of provisions to aid injured people and such. You try finding another way to the place by going through a narrow pathway

Suddenly, a menacing armored person confronts you halfway through the narrow pathway. “You”, he says in an authoritative voice, pointing his sword at you. “You’re the one who barely survived the attack at the village”. “People around here have been talking. That you have been very lucky. But me? I think you’re more than lucky. You have been chosen to be in a bigger role than you can imagine.” He plants his sword in the ground. “Meet me in the Pilgrimage Site. We will discuss this further when the time comes.” You hear a commotion behind you, and the moment you look back, the person disappears.

### **Scene 4 (Class Creation)**

Emerging from the pathway, you see the barracks in front of you. A person recognizes you from the barracks and immediately grabs you. “No time to waste! You’re already behind schedule!”. He takes you into the barracks and puts you into a room full of weapons and armor. “For someone who has an important task, you sure are late! Here, choose whatever you want or need. You are going to need it for that task. Not to mention, a lot of volunteers have been draining the barracks of equipment”. You hear something outside and the person immediately screams, “Give me a moment, I’m coming!”, storming outside in a hurry.

**This is the part where the player can choose their class**

You pick up everything you need and the person comes back. “Oh good, you’re all ready. Now, leave. I still have a lot of things to tend to.” Another commotion happens and he screams at the door. “WILL YOU PEOPLE WAIT YOUR TURN”. Before any trouble begins, you immediately leave the barracks and continue your task of finding the place.

### **End of Prologue/Quest 1**


## **Quest 2: "Once Again"**

### **Scene 1:**

From the barracks, you see the way towards the place has been cleared. You continue your walk. You encounter a very busy place full of parchments and such. It seems that you’re in a courier service.

**The player is free to ask NPCs.**

- **NPCs will answer the following:**

	- **The parchment being letters**
	- **Some of the boxes being packages**
	- **Ever since the war, the service has been in disarray**

**Interacting a certain NPC (Guild Receptionist) will progress the quest**

A guild receptionist recognizes you and asks you about your current task. This confuses you but confirms that this place is indeed where you work.

- **1.** “Can you please remind me what it is again?” - the keeper says it’s an important one
- **2.** “Oh yeah, the task. Uhh, what was it again?” - the keeper rolls their eyes and says it’s an important task.
- **3.** “What task?” - the keeper is confused but she reminds you it’s important.

A crowd of people exclaims for you to wait your turn. The keeper is seen to be exhausted to be angry but she gives you directions to the person who assigned the task.

Inside the busy building are piles of unsorted piles of parchment being sorted by only a handful of people. A door can be seen at the end of the building and you enter.

A woman greets you and asks you how the delivery went. You shake your head and shrug. The woman notices the injury in your head and becomes concerned. She deduces that you may have forgotten your task thanks to the injury so she explains it in secrecy. But before that, she made sure that no one outside the door may be listening.

“You have an important task given upon you. A letter and a package sent by the queen herself. You were supposed to meet with someone to get the package from the village, but everyone said that the village was attacked.”

She asks you if you still have the letter and the package, but you don’t remember the apothecary giving you anything. She sighs in worry, but she immediately composes herself.

“I do not know how to help you, but I suggest you start with the people who helped you here. Perhaps the apothecary who tended to you.”  She presents a crest. “You almost forgot this, but it’s a miracle you did. You need to present this alongside the letter.”

A knock is heard from the door. She stands and acknowledges. “You may go, good luck”.

### **Scene 2:**

You exit the door and went outside the building. You remember something about the apothecary saying about someone carrying you to the hospital. They may know something.

You go back to the hospital and find the apothecary. You ask if they know the whereabouts of the person who carried you back here.

The answer may depend on what choice you have picked on who to attack in the prologue

- **Attack Armored Person** - the apothecary says that the person who was carrying you was one of the invading force and is now on the chopping block. Though you can find him in the prison as the beheading is still in the later afternoon.
- **Attack Robed Person** - the apothecary says that the person has been recently released from the hospital and can be found in the barracks.

You go to the person who saved you earlier. You thank them and ask if they saw something from them being taken before they found you.

They explain that there was someone who took the package from you discreetly. Though it looked like one of them wore the emblem of the Caravan Company.

**If the player saves the robed person, they will invite the player to The Legion of Ahmed, giving him a keyword that grants him to enter the encampment near the village.** 


- **SPECIAL EVENT** 
	- The Legionnaire will insist on staying in the cell as, in his own words, “My part is not yet in play.”. Guards immediately approach and unlock the cell to escort the prisoner. He stops and looks at you. “You have proven yourself worthy of The Prophet. But the question remains. Are you simply His audience, or will you be part of the grand play?”. He then resumes his walk with the guards to the outside of the prison.

### **Scene 3:**

You exit out of the building and see a crowd of people gathering somewhere.

- **Asking the NPCs will answer the following:**
	- **An execution is said to be happening**
	- **It’s a captured Legionnaire from the Legion of Ahmed**
	- **Something is said to be happening, so they went along**

You follow along the crowd to the plaza and see the Legionnaire alongside a couple of guards and an executioner on a wooden platform. The Legionnaire is bound on a pillory. The crowd throws debris at the Legionnaire whilst being called names and such. “This state’s salvation is at hand! The Prophet alongside his disciples will cleanse the lands of weakness, and from the ashes, a state pure and free from corruption will arise!”, shouted the Legionnaire. The crowd boos the Legionnaire but you can feel a change of emotion in the air. It is anger, with a tinge of fear. “Worry not! We will all be free of suffering by His will! Long live the prophet! Long live the Legio-”. Before the Legionnaire finishes his last words, the executioner’s axe swiftly cuts down his neck followed by a thud on the platform. The Legionnaire is dead, and the crowd angers still. You immediately leave the plaza, and focus on the matter on your hand.

### **End of Quest 2**

## **Quest 3: "Finders Keepers"**

### **Scene 1:**

The player can ask around the town whether they know something about the Caravan Company.

- **The NPCs will answer the following:**
	- **They’re a private company**
	- **They’re the ones who handle discreet operations**
	- **They’re usually very hard to find**

**Talking to all the NPCs will progress the quest. The final NPC will give the player a big hint:**

- “If you saw someone who bears their emblem, they’re probably nearby”

You remember that the person who carried you to the hospital said something about someone discreetly taking something from you when you were unconscious.

With knowledge of the mysterious Company, you venture out of the capital to investigate even further. Starting with their last known appearance: Wuthering.

You immediately went to the village, hoping that you would find any clues.

### **Scene 2:**

### **Wuthering:**

You return to the town where the invasion began. Wuthering. Once it was a town of life. Now, it's a charred mess of buildings and mounds of corpses. A town of lifelessness and death. You can see survivors weeping and children wandering around calling for their mothers and fathers.

- **Asking NPCs in the area will answer the following:**

	- **The Legion burned the place to the ground**
	- **Where was Thomasia when the village fell (I hope someone gets this)**
	- **It’s now dangerous around here now that the Legion’s encampment is set nearby.**

**Only one NPC will progress the quest.**

You see the tavernkeep kneeling over a burning building. He immediately recognizes you from before the attack while you were very drunk.

You ask him if he remembers what you did before you got drunk and were you carrying anything before the attack. He tries and remembers that you were meeting with someone in the tavern before getting knee-deep in the mead. He also remembers that you were carrying what looks like a courier’s bag before dragging yourself out of the tavern. He exclaimed and apologized that amidst the chaos, he cannot help you get to safety.

- **Asking him about the Caravan Company will lead you to the direction of these 3 places:**
	- **Thomasian Pilgrimage Site**
	- **Summonwater Village**
	- **Heretic’s Tower**

He will also give you the emblem as he found it somewhere in mud while the village was still being attacked.

You thank the tavernkeep and continue your journey.

**The Player is now open to explore anywhere. Though some can only be entered whenever they have done a particular task such as saving the Legionnaire in the Prologue giving you access to the Legion of Ahmed’s Encampment, or when the story permits them to.**

**For now, the player can only visit the three places where the caravan can be found.**

- **The caravan can be found once in these three places at random:**
	- **Somewhere in the Thomasia Pilgrimage Site**
	- **Summonwater Village**
	- **Outside of Heretic’s Tower**

**Though the player will not know where they actually are unless they ask around the places.**

### **Thomasia Pilgrimage Site:**

You visit the site in hopes that you will find a trace of the Company.

The Thomasia Pilgrimage Site. People often believe that pilgrimage is one of the ways to show your faith to a religion. “To strengthen the bond with your god,” you must go on a long and arduous journey to sacred sites. This is one of them, but you’re here for something else.

You always thought that these sites are not that crowded, but you guessed wrong. You can’t discern between people of Thomasian and people who are not. Ever since the start of the wars, people have been flocking to pilgrimage sites to prove that they are worthy of the love of their god. That, or they are just scared of the punishment that the other religions are carrying out to those who don't have one.

- **Asking the NPCs will answer the following:**
	- **Their journey to this site has been very arduous especially since the start of the wars**
	- **They’re here to “prove their fate”, but it can be seen that they are only doing it to avoid punishment.**

**The last NPC asked will continue the quest**

You asked a follower of Thomasia if they have seen anyone who bears the emblem of the Caravan, while also showing the emblem itself

**If the Company is in this place, proceed to the bottom portion of the quest after the Outside of Heretic’s Tower. If not, continue.**

She says that she saw a caravan going in the direction of Summonwater and Heretic’s Tower. Other than that, she didn’t see anyone as of now bearing the emblem and apologized.

You thank her and continue your task to find the Company.

### **Summonwater Village:**

You enter the village in hopes that you will find a trace of the Company.

Upon entering the village you expect it to be bustling with people only to be met with empty stalls and militia wandering around the roads. “Where have they all gone to?”, you ask yourself.

- **Knocking on doors will give you the following answers**
	- **They will ask if it’s safe to go outside now**
	- **They will shoo the player away**
	- **They will ask if you are a wandering seller**

**A local militia will approach you and continue the story.**

A local militia took notice of your disturbance to the people and asked you your business. You answer that you’re confused about what is happening and where the people are. She answers that the town has been paranoid ever since the attack on the neighboring village and has been mandated to stay in their houses for the time being.

You pull the emblem out of your pocket and ask her if she saw anyone who bears the emblem of the Caravan.

**If the Company is in this place, proceed to the bottom portion of the quest after the Outside of Heretic’s Tower. If not, continue.**

She says that she saw a caravan stop by earlier but didn’t know where they went. She hypothesizes that they may have gone to the direction of the Pilgrimage Site or the Heretic’s Tower.

You thank the soldier and she returns to her post. You continue your task of finding the Company elsewhere.

### **Outside of Heretic’s Tower:**

You enter the area of the infamous Heretic’s Tower in hopes that you will find a trace of the Company.

This place is said to have a dark history behind it. No one knows why and how it came to be, but it is advised to stay away from the building itself. Nevertheless, you entered the grounds of the infamous tower.

You see a small group of militia guarding the area of the tower itself. Who would’ve thought that this place is still being guarded? It does raise some questions but you focus on the task instead.

You ask the militia if they have seen someone who bears the emblem you are currently showing.

The militia points to their scout.

**If the Company is in this place, proceed to the bottom portion of the quest after the Outside of Heretic’s Tower. If not, continue.**

The scout answers that they have not seen anyone nor have they encountered anyone who bears the emblem. Though she notes that she saw what looks like a caravan going in the direction of Summonwater and the Pilgrimage Site.

You thank the scout but before you can leave she stops you and asks for her payment. Though she immediately says that it was a joke and you continue your business finding the Company.

**If the Caravan Company is in the vicinity:**

She remembers someone passing by who bears the symbol. They point the direction of where the person went and you immediately follow.

### **Scene 3:**

The place points to a somewhat vegetated area covered by trees and bushes. They do not excel in hiding that well, kind of, but they are a service. You can’t offer your services if no one can find you, can they now?

Emerging from the bushes, you see tents set up alongside horses. A person comes out of the tent that bears the emblem of the Company. You immediately deduced that you have found the Company. The question now is: Will they comply, or will you have to force it out of them?

You wait until the cloaked figure exits the vicinity and you discreetly enter the tent.

You see a small table with a map in the middle. From the table, you see someone rummaging through documents.

You get his attention and he immediately snaps at you. “Oh, a new customer. You have pretty keen senses for someone who can find us. So, how can we help you? Do you need to acquire something from someone? Peruse our catalogs? Or something else that you have in your mind?”. You ask the person for a package. “A package? You must’ve confused us for a courier service.”

- **The player can now choose how they will get the information:**
- **State your purpose - a secret to a secret organization. You say that you’re here to retrieve a package sent by the Queen herself. The person laughs and belittles you for your embarrassing attempt. Although the person’s emotion changes upon showing the crest. He immediately becomes scared and tells you what he knows.**
- **Threaten the man - you threaten the man by readying your weapon at him. He laughs at you and calls his guards. “Let’s take this outside. Can’t let you damaging my business and assets now, would I?”. This initiates a combat sequence. After being dealt enough damage, the guards will run away and leave the man alone for questioning.**
- **Bribe the man - you comb through your pockets and present a hefty sum. The man’s eyes brighten and show a big, shin-eating grin. The man will answer any of your questions.**

The man explains everything to you. “We took care of the package, indeed. Even the process of procuring it all thanks to this whole Legion thing. What’s even better is you drowning in your own fairytale land. Though, if I only have the package on my hand right now, then you’ll be happy no? But no, just a tad too little too late. Tell me, how well can you chase someone?”. You immediately remember someone exiting the tent earlier. The man confirms that the person indeed has the package and you immediately run after the person.

### **End of Quest 3**

## **Quest 4: "Small Importances"**

### **Scene 1:**

Immediately after emerging from the bushes, you see the person going into Summonwater village and immediately give chase. If this man gets away now, you won’t be able to get the package.

The man immediately notices you and sprints towards the alleys in hopes of losing you.

- **This is now a chase sequence. A player is given a choice to follow the man directly or to take a detour in hopes of catching up. The player can choose between two options:**
	- **Keep chasing him - the man is right then and there. Just keep running after him. The only question is: which legs will fail first, yours or theirs?**
	- **Find a detour to close the gap - check whether there is a possible detour on the way. If luck is on your side right now, it could close the gap. Or widen it.**

**The chase will and always end in you cornering the man, but taking a detour will either give you a boost, or slow you even further.**

### **Scene 2:**

Eventually you corner him into an alley. Both of you are gasping for air from the exhaustion, but the man eventually catches their breath. “Y-you… don’t know… *gasp* what you’re doing.” He grabs something from behind him. “Listen, kid, turn back. What you’re trying to get back is something far more important than you can imagine.” He unsheathes something. “Turn around right now and tell whoever you’re serving right now that you’ve lost this thing, walk away from it.”

You declined the offer, and he reveals two daggers. “Don’t make me do this.”.

**The player is now in a combat encounter. Whatever happens, the man will surrender and will never die.**

### **Scene 3:**

In the middle of the fight, the package is damaged. Out flies a key into the muddy grounds of the alleyway. The man is on the ground and drops his daggers. “Take it. I don’t want to take any part in this.” You pick up the damaged package with the letter and the muddied key and immediately clean it. It is a strangely heavy key decorated with an emblem and is inscribed with words. You pocket it immediately and leave the alleyway. “Hey, before you go.”, says the man behind you. “I can’t change your mind on this whole matter, but he can.” You stopped and listened to the man. “Fort Farroth, a man who goes by Nik. When you find him, tell him 'a knight in the gallows'. "

Curiosity consumes you. This key, sent by the queen herself, holds something more than it looks like. Why would a key be this important? Better yet, why would anyone want it? For only a little gold? The man who was keeping it looked like they were protecting it with their life but they stopped and gave it to you in hopes of you understanding. There is certainly something going on, and you must uncover it.

You now set your destination to Fort Faroth.

### **End of Quest 4**

## **Quest 5: “...To Rule Them All”**

### **Scene 1:**

From a distance you see a small castle-esque building with what seems like lines upon lines of soldiers marching from it. There is no mistake, it is Fort Farroth. And it seems that the state is acting on the advance of the Legion. You head on inside.

Upon entering the fort, you are greeted with countless soldiers training for combat and archery with great effort for the defense of their beloved state. Hundreds of weapons stationed in racks constantly being tended by their owners and armors being tempered by the local blacksmith.

**The player can now ask around to find the person they are looking for.**

- **The NPCs will answer the following:**
	- **They haven’t heard of anyone named Nik**
	- **They used to have a Nik around, until an arrow took their knee and died in battle**
	- **“Nik? Like a nick in the sword or something?”**

**Exhausting their dialogue will proceed to the next scene.**

### **Scene 2:**

Suddenly, a heavily guarded group comes out from the interiors of the fort bearing a different set of attire from what you normally see. It seems to be councillors from different regions. You overhear their conversation.

“Finally, the state has made a move upon this matter. A state that is neutral is one to behold! Especially in these grim times, but sometimes a sacrifice in pride must be made for the greater good. That high and mighty sage is a hard nut to crack but the Legion’s advancements made it possible. Of course, it was only a matter of time before Old Sage Nik caves in.”

Your ears prick up. Is this the man who was meant to receive the package?

You immediately walked to the entrance inside the Fort before being stopped by the guards. “State your purpose”, says the left guard.

- **The player can choose what to do:**
- **State their purpose - you state that you have something for the sage. “The High Sage has been expecting you.” They lower their spears and let you enter.**
- **Ask if Old Sage Nik is inside - “Who is asking?” says the right guard. You respond by saying that you are a courier who is supposed to deliver something for him. They lower their weapons and they let you enter.**
- **Present the damaged package - they immediately inspected the package and they see an emblem from the queen. They lower their weapons and let you enter the fort.**

### **Scene 3:**

You see a group of people surrounding a table discussing with each other. They immediately leave and you see an old man at the center of the table. You hypothesized that this man is the one who you're looking for and approached him.

You approach the old man and immediately get his attention. He asks you to state your purpose as he has a lot of things to do. You mutter the words “A knight in the gallows” and he immediately looks around. “Not here, follow me”. He stands up and you follow him into a room.

In the room, you show the key and he asks you to give it to him. You retract your arm and state that you are the original courier of the key and ask why he orchestrated the whole ordeal.

“So, you are the man who has been tasked to the key. You have all the reason to give it back to the queen, but I can tell that you have a lot of questions on your mind. The purpose and the gravity of this little key right?”

He offers you a seat, and he expounds on its use. He doesn’t know the true use of the key except one. To anyone the key is nothing, but it controls something far more important. The state itself. He originally took if from you to safekeep if from anyone, even the queen herself. If it falls to the wrong hands, even if it is the state itself, it can spell doom to the inhabitants of the state itself. He tells you that he has a lot in his hand and he doesn’t want to draw attention, but he knows where to start to know the true purpose of the key. He gives you directions to a museum in the capital. “There, you must find something that carries the symbol and the words of the key, it will guide you to the answer. And as always, ‘a knight at the gallows’ is the keyword.” He opens the door and you follow him.

Instead of insisting on you giving him the key, he lets you keep it. “You are the one who is supposed to deliver it after all”, he said and returned to his usual activities.

You set your next destination to the museum in the Capital.

### **End of Quest 5**

## **Quest 6: “Of Symbols and Ciphers”**

### **Scene 1:**

You went back to the capital and followed the directions of the Old Sage. Upon arriving you were surprised that the building that greets you is a tavern instead. You ask around in confusion and everyone answers that the building WAS a museum. The owner couldn’t raise enough money to keep the building so the man who owns the tavern, well, owns it now.

### **Scene 2:**

You enter the inn and are greeted by the smell of food and mead in the air. It’s a tavern alright, and it’s packed with people. You take a seat and ask the barkeeper and he asks you what you want. You answer the keyword and the barkeeper calls for someone. A girl comes by and the barkeeper whispers something to her. He asks you to come with him. You follow him into the back of the tavern, where barrels of alcohol and the likes are stored. He points to a specific spot in the room and you look closer.

It’s an old, normal-looking pipe. What’s different with it is that it bears the same emblem in the key though on a much smaller scale, looking like a metalwork company’s emblem. The barkeeper hypothesized that this pipe has been present when the museum was still standing. The Old Sage’s man took notice of this and asked the barkeeper to keep it a secret for now. You feel like following this pipe may lead you closer to the answer but this may prove to be a harder task.

You remember that this used to be a museum, maybe the old owner knows something about the pipe. You ask the barkeeper if he knows where the old owner lives and gives you directions. You exit the tavern and find the old owner.

### **Scene 3:**

You stop by a semi-dilapidated building and knock on the door. A woman greets you and kindly asks about your business. You explain that you are finding the owner of the used-to-be museum and she lets you in.

Compared to the outside, the interiors of the house are much neater. She offers you a seat and asks you to wait as she asks for her father.

After a few minutes, you are greeted by an old man. Though, he still is as vibrant as if he is still in his younger ages. He takes a seat and offers you tea. You ask him about the pipe in the tavern and he asks you not to tear it down as it carries history. 

He explains that there used to be a group of very clever and talented scholars that are said to serve under the State that bears the symbol and words but they disappeared one day. Some say it is because of the rampant killings of anyone who takes part in “scorcery”. He says that it's a shame as if the project were finished, who knows what the pipe really is for. He suggests that you dig deeper into this mystery and get to the bottom of it and suggests that you follow it. 

He hints at you that the tavern isn’t only one that exists, and it can be found everywhere. Though, there is only one that is worth investigating. It’s a tough task but it will get you closer to the answer.” He says it is located in the Lower District and bid you farewell and goodluck.

You thank him for the tea and go to your next task.

### **End of Quest 6.**

## **Quest 7: “Secrets Buried”**

### **Scene 1:**

You head straight to the Lower District to investigate the emblem-marked point of interest.

You ask around the district if they see any monument that bears any weird emblems.

The locals point you to the direction of a certain location dubbed “The Rat’s Nest”, you thank the locals and go to the location.

### **Scene 2:**

You see a weird block of pipes shaped into a block of cube. Funnily enough, it does look like a rat’s nest, just cube shaped. Upon closer inspection, you can see what seems to be the emblem, though it is unrecognizable until you look closely. It seems that someone doesn’t want to know about this.

A man approaches you and initiates a conversation. He asks what are the theoretical applications of this structure and what could be its origins. Was it a mishap that was built but it worked so they didn’t bother fixing it? Was it something the state was doing for something else big? Who knows, but the man’s specificity on the matter was odd. You ask him if he knows something else about this structure and he nods. You laugh, but you realize that he wasn’t joking. He may know something that will lead you to the answer itself. You share a small knowledge about the pipes and he looks amazed and surprised. “You’re looking for answers, no? I can tell you but not here.” He invites you to his home to further discuss the matter. You follow.

### **End of Quest 7.**

## **Quest 8: “For the Greater Good”**

### **Scene 1:**

You entered his home and led you into his small library. Impressive as it may be, questions popped into your mind. Who might this man be?

He offers you a chair and he asks you a question. “How much do you know?”. You explain that the only thing that you knew is that it exists everywhere and it used to be a project of the scholars of the state. He is impressed but he says that you are missing something. 

He presents himself as one of the scholars who worked on it who is now fearing that the state may use the system of the pipes indecisively. He explains that the pipes were designed mainly as a defense mechanism, though the scholars themselves had no interest in it. Only that the research that they were conducting will contain said pipes.”Magna Parva Sarcinas. It’s latin for “great things in small packages”, he explained. You remember the key having the same inscriptions as what he said. He explains that they were conducting an experiment on rats, but the research ultimately failed, and are now holding something that will be the death of all.

### **Scene 2:**

He stands up and tries to take a book from a bookshelf, but it instead moves the entire bookshelf and presents a pipe that bears the same emblem as the previous pipe. He said that he has been examining the rats ever since, and they have been getting worse. He says that if the key is ever used, the death of the state, nay, the entirety of the country will occur. 

You immediately clutch the key in fear of the thought. He sees this and immediately guesses that you carry the key. He asks you to properly think of whoever you are going to give the key to.

### **Scene 3:**

Alongside the pipe is a narrow hallway, the man explains it as a pathway to every pipe there is. For maintenance purposes. He tells you a specific direction to follow as it will lead you to where the key will be inserted.

You follow what seems to be an endless hallway with no end. You enter another path according to the directions and you hear people speaking on the other wall. You deduce from the voices that you are inside the upper city gate-keep. You keep going and you see a crack in the wall. You hear someone talking about a key going missing, its importance, and its danger. Upon peeking, it’s the princess of the state talking to someone. The room has an apparatus in the middle with a spot for the key. You go back from the path you came from and now understand that the key was actually a delivery for the princess.

### **End of Quest 8**

### **Quest 9: “The Forked Path”**

**This quest is dependent on the side quests as the player will now give the key to one of the major quests. The outcome of the story will depend on what faction gets the key.**

**To progress the main quest, the player must finish one of the factions’ quest lines until their pre-finale step.**

**After clearing the quest line of a faction, the player may now give the key to the faction and progress to the final quest.**

### **Quest 10: "Chosen One"**
