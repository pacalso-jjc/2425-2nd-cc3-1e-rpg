- **Backstory:**
  - Stalker Svignee oversees the operations and presence of the Thomasian faith in the region. Before he was indoctrinated into the faith and assumed the role that he plays now, he used to be a criminal that terrorized the streets of the neighboring state of Kent.

### **Princess Diane Yvette (Heir to the State)**
- **Role:** Faction vendor and advisor (FOR GAMEPLAY PURPOSES, SHE CANNOT BE KILLED)

  - "In My Time of Need" - A guardian of Diane will approach and make contact with the player as soon as they enter the capital and they have met the two other factions.
- **Backstory:**
  - Born into a poor family in the slums outside the capital then being adopted by the Archduke and his family, Princess Diane has seen every corner of Yrmania and heavily sympathizes with the poor that reside outside the capital walls. She has seen the violence and hardship that they go through on an almost daily basis and as a noble and heir to the throne does whatever it takes to alleviate their burdens; this is in stark contrast to her now noble family who live lavish lives within the thick walls of the Upper City. 

### **Prophet Ahmed (Head of the Legion)**

- **Backstory:**
  - Known as a skilled and famous warrior hailing from the faraway land known as the Hammerfell, Ahmed struggled to find his life's true purpose during his youth. He first began service as a soldier in the Rajj's army in Hammerfell but eventually left his company to pursue enlightenment and become a monk. After a time, his enlightenment came which formed the basis for the faith of the Legion of Ahmed, and thus it was only a matter of time before this small nomadic army became a strong militaristic dictatorship under the rule of its prophet.

## Areal NPCs

### **Quartermaster A'jak'nir Jeera (State Army Quartermaster)**
- **Role:** Quartermaster and manager of the State's main fort where most of its army is stationed
- **Allegiance:** Neutral
- **Personality:** Is a disciplined but troublesome and cautious quartermaster who is anxious about the outcome of the conflict between the two opposing religious factions

- **Quest Hook:**  
  - "Symbiosis:Thomasia/The Legion/Diane" - Depending on the player's current allegiance, their respective faction vendor may send them to this fort to secure the support of the massive army stationed there. Stalker Svignee will request the player to assassinate Jeera and replace her with a Thomasian sympathizer, Ahmed will stage a siege, and Diane will ask the player to request her aid diplomatically.
- **Backstory:**
  - Despite being respected by the capital and most of Yrmania as the pseudo-head of the army, Jeera is actually from the Hammerfell, where the rights of women were reduced to that of mere pets or possessions. Jeera narrowly escaped this cruel prospect and fled first to Kent and then finally to Yrmania where she enlisted in the state's local military. She proved a great soldier, but after she was gravely injured during a previous assault on the capital, she became an equally great and wise quartermaster.

## Minor Faction NPCs

- **Backstory:**
  - Born into nobility, training for the military at an early age, and being knighted at the age of 19, Hans was just as knight as all of his other peers during his short time serving in the military in the outskirts of the capital. However, the decades have not been kind to him at all, as he has seen and endured all that conflict has to offer. Now at the age of 56, Hans still chooses to serve and protect those in the Upper City, bearing both the glories and scars of war.

### **Lady Orin (Scion of Bhaal)**
- **Role:** Leader of the Cult of Bhaal that operates in secret within the capital

- **Quest Hook:**  
  - "A Father's Love" - When the player enters the slums outside the capital after meeting the three major factions, they will start to receive bloodstained letters from an unknown source. Finding this unknown source will start this entire questline involving Orin.
- **Backstory:**
  - When Thomasia entered the walls of the capital and its followers preached their words of faith, their missives, and their wisdoms, not all within the city accepted them with open arms. One of many religions that opposed the Thomasian faith is the Cult of Bhaal, a secretive society fanatically devoted to serving Bhaal, a pagan "God of Murder". Orin was a child of such, but upon being conceived at the altar by the previous leader of the cult, it is said that she spoke a prophecy so frightful and horrid that the other members were compelled to think that she was the true child of Bhaal himself.
